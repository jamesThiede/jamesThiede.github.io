        <h3>7/19</h3>
        <h3>10:30-6:40</h3>
        <p>Fell asleep pretty quick because I was worn out from work and waking up early for gym and such. Woke up around 3, didn't start falling asleep again untill around 4, then half woke up around 5:30-ish. Hit snooze about 3 times</p>

        <h3>7/20</h3>
        <h3>9:00-6:30</h3>
        <p>I took a nap from about 6-8 which prevented me from falling asleep for awhile</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/21</h3>
        <h3>9:00-6:30</h3>
        <p>Fell asleep early due to lack of sleep from the previous night and lack of naps. I woke up at about 1 and pretty much didn't get back to good sleep, had a lot of nightmares too</p>

        <h3>7/22</h3>
        <h3>12:30-6</h3>
        <p>Was tired but stayed up late-ish, woke up early and couldn't fall back asleep</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/23</h3>
        <h3>1:00-12:00</h3>
        <p>The lack of sleep the previous night caused me to take a 4 hour nap. Had minimal tossing and turning and waking up but still not great. Woke up at 8, stared at my phone/computer for about two hours then fell back asleep for a little</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/24</h3>
        <h3>11:00-6:51</h3>
        <p>Hit snooze a few times, but all things considered, I would say I slept "well," which means less waking up and stuff than I'm used to, but still more waking up than the average person does. No naps the previous day!</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/25</h3>
        <h3>2:00-6:30</h3>
        <p>Tried to go to bed but a stray cat wandered in to my house and I had a hard time kicking him out. Woke up slightly before the alarm, but kept snoozing until about 7:30</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/26</h3>
        <h3>1:30-6:30</h3>
        <p>I am seeing a pattern of me staying up really late emerge and I'm not loving that lol. I did take a 2 hour nap which is why I was up so late. But i also had to make awesome eggs for breakfast! The weahter has been cooler which I think haas helped but still a ton of tossin' and turnin'</p>

        <h3>7/27</h3>
        <h3>2:00-7:00</h3>
        <p>I got practically no sleep the previous day nor did I take a nap and I still took forever to fall asleep and slept super lightly and ugh :(</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/28</h3>
        <h3>12:30-7:00</h3>
        <p>I made it far enough in to this entry to write down the date and time I slept, but none of the details apparently</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7/29</h3>
        <h3>12:30-9:00</h3>
        <p>I did not get to nap yesterday so I was pretty worn out. I recall waking up around 6:30 because my body seems to expect that, but luckily got in a few more hours. I don't exactly remember too much tossing and turning, I'm finding it harder and harder to remember as the nights go by. Is this what sleeping well looks like?</p>

        <h3>7/30</h3>
        <h3>2:00-10:00</h3>

        <hr>
        <h3>7/31</h3>
        <h3>2:00-6:30</h3>
        <p>I think I managed to stay asleep for the entire four and a half hours that I slept for. Woo!</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>8/1</h3>
        <h3>8:00-7:00</h3>
        <p>Didn't take a nap yesterday so I passed out pretty early. Slept great until about 2:45. Had trouble falling/staying asleep after that. Only hit snooze once though!</p>

        <h3>8/3</h3>
        <h3>11:00-6:30</h3>
        <p>Had a lot of insane dreams and nightmares. I do a ton of waking up then going to sleep on nights when these kind of dreams happen. Hit snooze like 3 times</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>8/4</h3>
        <h3>11:00-11:00</h3>
        <p>A rough estimate of when I fell asleep/woke up. I remember a tiny bit of bad sleep but nothing I couldn't handle.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>8/5</h3>
        <h3>?-8:30</h3>
        <p>Was watching a movie and passed out during it so I really have no concept of when I fell asleep... Started doing the whole wake up fall asleep thing real early in the AM. Not fun :(</p>

                        <p>According to the "experts," one should only be in bed when they are sleeping. So I have tried the whole get-out-of-bed-and-do-something-productive-when-you-can't-sleep thing, but that leads to me staying up all night and not getting any sleep at all.</p>

                            <li>I think the most effective method is either meditation or excercising, both of which I am kind of on an okay schedule for! I need to be more consistent at home for meditation though.</li>
                            <li>I am not sure if there are any methods I have heard of that I haven't but that is probably because I am a little exhausted at the moment. Also not sure which to try first, I am not the expert in charge of the project!!!</li>
                            <li>Oh wow this nap question is quite a lot... There is no rhyme or reason to them. Sometimes I take them every day, other times only like every other day. They usually last about 1 to 3 hours. Usually the best sleep I get is when I nap. I rarely sleep entirely through them but I wake up in the middle far less than I do when I sleep at night, and I am in a much deeper sleep than at night. Also, it is not uncommon for me to pass out right when get </li>

                <p class="words">V_1.1: Further analysis of my previous attempts has certainly continued to make me think more about what I can do differently in my attempts to sleep better, so thats good. I hope I answered everything to your liking!</p>
                <p class="words">V_1.0 (Initial Release): This exercise here has helped in that it has allowed me to reflect on what methods I have tried and has got me thinking on why I was unsuccessful. While a lack of proper documentation is certainly not helping identify specific reasons for failure, I am noticing that I probably have a strong lack of commitment to almost all of these techniques. That being said, I feel like this was a good first step. I think this new project of yours might actually work!</p>

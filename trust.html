    <h2>A Brief History of V H S</h2>
    <p>The Video Home System (VHS) is a standard for consumer-level analog video
       recording on tape cassettes. Developed by Victor Company of Japan (JVC)
       in the early 1970s, it was released in Japan in late 1976 and in the USA
       in early 1977.</p>
    <p>From the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording became a major contributor
       to the television industry, via the first commercialized video tape
       recorders (VTRs). At that time, the devices were used only in expensive
       professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging
       (fluoroscopy). In the 1970s, videotape entered home use, creating the
       home video industry and changing the economics of the television and
       movie businesses. The television industry viewed videocassette recorders
       (VCRs) as having the power to disrupt their business, while television
       users viewed the VCR as the means to take control of their hobby. In the
       1980s and 1990s, at the peak of VHS's popularity, there were videotape
       format wars in the home video industry. Two of the formats, VHS and
       Betamax, received the most media exposure. VHS eventually won the war;
       dominating 60 percent of the North American market by 1980 and succeeding
       as the dominant home video format throughout the tape media period.
    <p>Optical disc formats later began to offer better quality than analog
       consumer video tape such as standard and super-VHS. The earliest of these
       formats, LaserDisc, was not widely adopted. However, after the
       introduction of the DVD format in 1997, VHS's market share began to
       decline. By 2008, DVD had achieved mass acceptance and replaced VHS as
       the preferred low end method of distribution.</p>
